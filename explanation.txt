This code generates a dynamic spiral pattern using an artistic structure driven by pseudo-random values. The spiral is created by iterating through a sequence of values derived from the "Bee Movie" script. These values are generated by reading the script and using the ordinal (ASCII) value of each character to modify the current position in the sequence. Specifically, the index of the sequence is incremented by the ordinal value of the current character, and this process is repeated for every character in the script. The generated sequence is then used to control the radius of the spiral, creating a visually unique, evolving pattern. The colors and transparency of the lines change as the spiral grows, adding further artistic flair. The result is a colorful, dynamic spiral that reflects the character data from the Bee Movie script.
