# Dynamic Spiral Pattern Using "Bee Movie" Script
[View the Sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/c_reed/sketches/jQcEiJ5B3)

This project generates a dynamic spiral pattern driven by pseudo-random values derived from the "Bee Movie" script. By iterating through a sequence of values, each derived from the ASCII values of the script's characters, the code creates a visually unique and evolving spiral.

## How It Works

1. **Value Generation**: 
   - The "Bee Movie" script is read character by character.
   - For each character, its ASCII value (the numeric representation of the character) is retrieved using the `ord()` function.
   - This ASCII value is used to increment the sequence's index, making the next characterâ€™s index shift by the value of the current character's ASCII code. This process continues until the entire script is parsed.

2. **Spiral Creation**:
   - The sequence of generated values is used to control the radius of the spiral at each iteration.
   - As the spiral grows, the radius values cause it to expand in a tight, dynamic manner. The changing values produce a visually intriguing and ever-evolving pattern.
   - In addition to the spiral's shape, the colors and transparency of the lines also change as the spiral grows, adding fluid, artistic effects to the pattern.

## Value Generation Insights

The pseudo-random values are derived from the "Bee Movie" script, using the characters' ASCII values to iteratively modify the sequence's index. Since the English language has a wide variety of characters but not too many repeating patterns, I thought it would be interesting to use this large data set for generating random values. With the approach I used, the distribution of values should remain fairly balanced. Since the ASCII values of the characters aren't overly biased in a way that would skew the random distribution, the results are fairly even across the sequence. Plus, as the script's length is large, it provides a nice, diverse range of values without having to worry too much about patterns influencing the outcome.
