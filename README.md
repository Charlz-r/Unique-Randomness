# Dynamic Spiral Pattern Using "Bee Movie" Script

This project generates a dynamic spiral pattern driven by pseudo-random values derived from the "Bee Movie" script. By iterating through a sequence of values, each derived from the ASCII values of the script's characters, the code creates a visually unique and evolving spiral.

## How It Works

1. **Value Generation**: 
   - The "Bee Movie" script is read character by character.
   - The ASCII value of each character is used to modify the sequence's index, incrementing it based on the character's ordinal (ASCII) value.
   
2. **Spiral Creation**:
   - The sequence of generated values controls the radius of the spiral, causing it to grow and evolve.
   - As the spiral expands, the colors and transparency of the lines change, adding a fluid, artistic effect to the pattern.

## Visuals

The result is a colorful, dynamic spiral, with the character data from the "Bee Movie" script influencing the growth and aesthetic of the pattern. The ever-changing colors and transparency give the spiral a unique, evolving appearance.
